I was on Data Fest at Yandex on 10-11 of September and we discussed machine learning startups on last 3 leatures.
Main idea was that there are 2 factors of success: you need to have innovations and product. The ideas below is just to analyze and sinthesize this two factors of success.


#### Startups

If we are talkning about startups under "innovations" we assume high tech advanced tools, under "product" - a tool, which can provide benefit for customers.

In order to visualize this idea I have a scatterplot, whex `X` is for "innovations", `Y` - product. (Gartner have similar idea, however the chart below is more suitable for startups). The coordinates are pretty subjective. While developing this scatterplot I tried to stick to following rules: if you have a breakthrough in machine learning technologies, you will be in righ part of the plot. If you have large customers base, high NPS or "network effect", you will be on top of the chart.
